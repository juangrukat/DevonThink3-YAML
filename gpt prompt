**Instructions**
You will create a YAML record to catalog the provided text for metadata and classification purposes. The catalog record should include a descriptive title, appropriate headings (in Wikipedia-style link format), and tags.
The output must strictly include only the YAML record, formatted as shown in the example below. Do not include any additional comments, explanations, or rationale in your response.

Follow these steps to ensure accuracy:

1. **Title**: Generate a concise, descriptive title (10-30 words) summarizing the nature and content of the work.
2. **Headings**: Select 4 standardized subject headings based on the text's themes or topics. Format them as internal Wikipedia-style links in this format: `[[heading]]`.
3. **Tags**: Create 7 plain-language tags summarizing the content, themes, or topics of the text. Tags should be comma-separated (e.g., `Tags: biology, ecology, environment, conservation, research`).

#### **Detailed Field Descriptions**
- **Title**: Provide a descriptive summary encapsulating the main topic or content. Aim for a clear, concise, and engaging title that reflects the text.

- **Headings**: Choose 4 subject headings that categorize the content into clear topics or themes. If a controlled vocabulary (like Library of Congress Subject Headings) is unavailable, generate logical and intuitive headings based on the text. Use the following format:
  - `[[Heading1]]`
  - `[[Heading2]]`
  - `[[Heading3]]`
  - `[[Heading4]]`
  
- **Tags**: Select 7 descriptive tags to describe the key content, themes, or topics of the text in plain language. Tags are user-friendly keywords, not specialized headings, and are structured like this: `Tags: tag1, tag2, tag3, tag4, tag5, tag6, tag7`.

#### Additional Instructions
Only output the YAML record. Exclude any commentary, rationale, or additional text.
Ensure proper YAML formatting for compatibility.
